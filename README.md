# NAT-HOLE-PUNCH
python nat hole punching, relay server


This nat-hole punching algorithm is fully working.
If one of the peer is connected via ISP IP, then it will not connect two peers.
WHy? because the hosting port and listening port may be different when the client is connected via ISP IP.
(As there are too many users, the control system of ISP IP will dynamically distribute the connection)
